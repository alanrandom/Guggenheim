This app was built starting with the hello-world code which I downloaded using angular cli, then modified as I learned more angular to fit the needs
of the requirements/spec file. A quick rundown of what I have:

dependencies: You will need angular cli. The further instructions on how to build, run, test, etc are all listed below 
(I have not changed them from the initial hello-world readme). 

How to Use: once the browser is up and running with ng serve, you should see a page on http://localhost:4200/ where you can enter in the fields specified 
in the requirements. Simply enter in appropriate values for those 4 fields, and a total will pop up on the bottom. 






# HelloWorld

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
